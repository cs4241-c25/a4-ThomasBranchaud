# Games List w/ GitHub Passport

Link to site hosted on Render: https://a4-thomasbranchaud.onrender.com/ 

This website is very similar to the previous version found within a3. The frontend has been ported to utilize React Components and Routes, and a new sign in button
has been added to the login page that allows a user to connect with their GitHub account.

There is no logout button. Instead, the user can return to the login page to login with a different account if they so choose. After returning to the login page the
user cannot return to the home page without logging in.
